# Winzling
Winzling is a tiny electronic load. It's barely larger than a DIP-12 footprint, and a big part of that is taken up by the pin header to connect things to it.

## Why
Why not?

## How
Pinname | Description
--------|------------
VCC|5V to power the thing⚡⚡⚡
GND|Ground... 😑
IN+|Positive end of the load⚡
IN-|Negative end of the load (Internally connected to ```GND```)
